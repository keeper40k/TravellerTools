Why is death reported after mandatory re-enlistment?

Investigate : Should I really be saving settings.json ? Is this really needed?

Settings:
  Need to add a "Do you want to save this character?" check when existing the application. (OnFormClosing event?)
  Need to store the settings file in a user data folder! (Need an active directory concept?)

Features: 
  Also, actually saving characters ... JSON format, and human readable format

String Usage:
  Need to add resources and remove strings from being embedded in classes.
