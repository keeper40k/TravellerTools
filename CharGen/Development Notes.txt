		Other
			Weapons profiles

Why is death reported after mandatory re-enlistment?

Investigate : Should I really be saving settings.json ? Is this really needed?

Settings:
  Need to add a "Do you want to save this character?" check when existing the application. (OnFormClosing event?)
  Need to store the settings file in a user data folder! (Need an active directory concept?)

String Usage:
  Need to add resources and remove strings from being embedded in classes.

Gear notes:
  Need to consider how to handle the variability of Brawling weapons (book 1, p.37)

Future
  When expanding to 18 services in the future, Draft probably needs to be an option.
  Fixed most issues with WeaponSelectionForm.  It still loses the enable on Select when switching between choices, but reselection in the combo box does sort it out.

----

Observed Defects:
  Gun selection (skill?) in Mustering out  - Perhpas Fixed?  Needs more testing

  Can Close skill selection dialog with (X) button before finished.
    (Is same for mustering out?)
  Look at rolling a 6 for Other service.  It waits for a new roll.
  Army - one musting roll of middle passing is given two middle passages?
    (Same for Low passage, actually, give 4!)
  Can Resize Weapon Choice Dialog. Should be fixed.

Observed Enhancements:
   None at this time.
