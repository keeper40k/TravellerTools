Why is death reported after mandatory re-enlistment?

Investigate : Should I really be saving settings.json ? Is this really needed?

Settings:
  Need to add a "Do you want to save this character?" check when existing the application. (OnFormClosing event?)
  Need to store the settings file in a user data folder! (Need an active directory concept?)

Features: 
  Also, actually saving characters ... JSON format, and human readable format

String Usage:
  Need to add resources and remove strings from being embedded in classes.

Future
  When expanding to 18 services in the future, Draft probably needs to be an option.
  Fixed most issues with WeaponSelectionForm.  It still loses the enable on Select when switching between choices, but reselection in the combo box does sort it out.
