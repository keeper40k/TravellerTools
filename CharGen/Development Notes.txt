NEXT STEPS: (Updated 18th Jan 2021)

Data for Character:
  Need to add:
	Work on Careers
      Started work on Services for CharGen. About 35% of the way through the EnlistServiceForm. 
	  Done basic service selection.  Need to work on the Draft, next, for failures.
	  Then it will be onto the details of each term of enlistment.
	  - Currently writing
			EnlistServiceForm

Other ...

Investigate : Should I really be saving settings.json ? Is this really needed?

Settings:
  Need to add a "Do you want to save this character?" check when existing the application. (OnFormClosing event?)
  Also, actually saving characters ... JSON format, and human readable format

String Usage:
  Need to add resources and remove strings from being embedded in classes.

Future
  When expanding to 18 services in the future, Draft probably needs to be an option.
