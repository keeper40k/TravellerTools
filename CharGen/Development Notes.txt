NEXT STEPS: (Updated 18th Jan 2021)

Data for Character:
  Need to add:
	Work on Careers
      Enlistment Complete.
	  Working on Processing the deatils of each Term of Service now.
	  Then it will be onto Aging, then Mustering Out.
	  - Currently writing
			CharGenMainForm
			  Re-enlistment
			    -  Need to consider if the ROLL after Enlistment should be renamed "Reenlist"
				-  Also, auto-processing of term one after Enlist.
	 - Needs to come soon ...
			TravellerSkill class
			Skills / characteristic acquisition in terms of service
			TravellerGear class
			Mustering Out
			Aging Effects

Other ...

Investigate : Should I really be saving settings.json ? Is this really needed?

Settings:
  Need to add a "Do you want to save this character?" check when existing the application. (OnFormClosing event?)
  Need to store the settings file in a user data folder! (Need an active directory concept?)

Features: 
  Also, actually saving characters ... JSON format, and human readable format

String Usage:
  Need to add resources and remove strings from being embedded in classes.

Future
  When expanding to 18 services in the future, Draft probably needs to be an option.
  When CharGen is complete, extract the data classes out to their own project for re-use elsewhere
